# Bookshelf scanner

**Automatically identify books on a bookshelf.**

Will need to install the [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) library.
Tesseract installation instructions can be found [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html).
For MacOS, the library can be installed with homebrew:

```bash
brew install tesseract
```
